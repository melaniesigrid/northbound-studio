/**
 * Shared abuse guards for the two public form endpoints.
 *
 * Files under api/ whose name starts with `_` are not routed by Vercel, so this
 * is a module rather than a function.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT. The contact form is now the site's only funnel — the
 * booking link is gone — so it is also the only thing between us and an inbox
 * of bots. Three cheap layers, in order of how much they actually catch:
 *
 *   1. HONEYPOT. A field a human never sees and never fills. Catches almost
 *      every scripted submitter, costs nothing, and cannot produce a false
 *      positive for a real person using a real browser.
 *   2. DWELL TIME. A human takes seconds to type a name, an address and a
 *      paragraph. A script posts in milliseconds.
 *   3. RATE LIMIT. Per IP, in memory.
 *
 * Layer 3 is deliberately weak and it is worth being honest about why: this is
 * a serverless function, so the Map below lives in one warm instance and Vercel
 * may run several. A determined attacker is spread across instances and resets
 * every cold start. It stops the accidental double-submit and the naive loop,
 * which is most of what actually arrives; it is not a defence against someone
 * who has decided to flood us. The real fix is a shared store (Vercel KV or
 * Upstash), and it is not worth a dependency until the volume justifies it.
